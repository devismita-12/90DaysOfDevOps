### <mark>What is Ansible?</mark>

**Ansible** is an open-source automation and orchestration tool for software configuration management and software deployment.

Ansible is popular for its simplicity of installation, ease of use in what concerns the connectivity to clients, its lack of agent for Ansible clients and the multitude of skills. It functions by connecting via [SSH](https://www.guru99.com/telnet-vs-ssh.html) to the clients, so it doesn’t need a special agent on the client side, and by pushing modules to the clients, the modules are then executed locally on the client side and the output is pushed back to the Ansible server.

Since it uses SSH, it can very easily connect to clients using SSH-Keys, simplifying the whole process.

## <mark>Why use Ansible?</mark>

* One of the most significant advantages of Ansible is that it is free to use by everyone.
    
* It does not need any special system administrator skills to install and use Ansible, and the official documentation is very comprehensive.
    
* Its modularity regarding plugins, modules, inventories, and playbooks make Ansible the perfect companion to orchestrate large environments.
    
* Ansible is very lightweight and consistent, and no constraints regarding the operating system or underlying hardware are present.
    
* It is also very secure due to its agentless capabilities and due to the use of OpenSSH security features.
    

## <mark>Important terms used in Ansible</mark>

* ### Ansible server
    
    The machine where Ansible is installed and from which all tasks and playbooks will be ran
    
* ### Module
    
    A module is a command or set of similar Ansible commands meant to be executed on the client side
    
* ### Task
    
    A task is a section that consists of a single procedure to be completed
    
* ### Role
    
    A way of organizing tasks and related files to be later called in a playbook
    
* ### Fact
    
    Information fetched from the client system from the global variables with the gather-facts operation
    
* ### Inventory
    
    A file containing data about the ansible client servers. Defined in later examples as host file
    
* ### Play
    
    Execution of a playbook
    

## <mark>Ansible Installation in Linux</mark>

Once you have compared and weighed your options and decided to go for Ansible, the next step is to have it installed on your system. We will go through the steps of installation in ubuntu OS.

## [Step 1 — Installing Ansible](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-20-04#step-1-installing-ansible)

1. sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
    

Press `ENTER` when prompted to accept the PPA addition.

Next, refresh your system’s package index so that it is aware of the packages available in the newly included PPA:

1. sudo apt update
    

Following this update, you can install the Ansible software with:

1. sudo apt install ansible
    

## [Step 2 — Setting Up the Inventory File](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-20-04#step-2-setting-up-the-inventory-file)

The *inventory file* contains information about the hosts you’ll manage with Ansible. You can include anywhere from one to several hundred servers in your inventory file, and hosts can be organized into groups and subgroups.

<mark>sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts</mark>

Create an inventory by adding the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of one or more remote systems to `/etc/ansible/hosts`. The following example adds the IP addresses of three virtual machines in KVM:

```plaintext
[servers]
server1 ansible_host=203.0.113.111
server2 ansible_host=203.0.113.112
server3 ansible_host=203.0.113.113

[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```

## [Step 3 — Testing Connection](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-20-04#step-3-testing-connection)

After setting up the inventory file to include your servers, it’s time to check if Ansible can connect to these servers and run commands via SSH.

The `all: vars` subgroup sets the `ansible_python_interpreter` host parameter that will be valid for all hosts included in this inventory. This parameter makes sure the remote server uses the `/usr/bin/python3` Python 3 executable instead of `/usr/bin/python` (Python 2.7), which is not present on recent Ubuntu versions.

When you’re finished, save and close the file by pressing `CTRL+X` then `Y` and `ENTER` to confirm your changes.

Whenever you want to check your inventory, you can run:

1. <mark>ansible-inventory --list -y</mark>
    

## [Step 3 — Testing Connection](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-20-04#step-3-testing-connection)

After setting up the inventory file to include your servers, it’s time to check if Ansible can connect to these servers and run commands via SSH.

For this guide, we’ll be using the Ubuntu **root** account because that’s typically the only account available by default on newly created servers. If your Ansible hosts already have a regular sudo user created, you are encouraged to use that account instead.

You can use the `-u` argument to specify the remote system user. When not provided, Ansible will try to connect as your current system user on the control node.

From your local machine or Ansible control node, run:

1. ansible servers -m ping

If this is the first time you’re connecting to these servers via SSH, you’ll be asked to confirm the authenticity of the hosts you’re connecting to via Ansible. When prompted, type `yes` and then hit `ENTER` to confirm.

Once you get a `"pong"` reply back from a host, means you’re ready to run Ansible commands and playbooks on that server.

## [Step 4 — Running Ad-Hoc Commands](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-20-04#step-4-running-ad-hoc-commands-optional)

Ansible command to see how much time the server is running

## Ansible Playbooks

**Ansible Playbooks** are a way of sending commands to remote systems through scripts. Ansible playbooks are used to configure complex system environments to increase flexibility by executing a script to one or more systems. Ansible playbooks tend to be more of a configuration language than a programming language.

Ansible playbook commands use YAML format, so there is not much syntax needed, but indentation must be respected. As the name says, a playbook is a collection of plays. Through a playbook, you can designate specific roles to some hosts and other roles to other hosts.

To have all the details precise before continuing with Ansible playbook examples, we must first define a task. These are the interfaces to Ansible modules for roles and playbooks.
