### Git Version Control System

A version control system is software that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It also allows you to work together with other programmers.

The version control system is a collection of software tools that help a team to manage changes in a source code. It uses a special kind of database to keep track of every modification to the code.

Developers can compare earlier versions of the code with an older version to fix the mistakes.

### Benefits of the Version Control System

The Version Control System is beneficial in software development; developing software without using version control is unsafe. It provides backups for uncertainty. Version control systems offer a speedy interface to developers. It also allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility according to the team scales to include more developers.

## Types of Version Control Systems:

* Centralized version control systems
    
* Distributed version control systems
    

### Centralized Version Control System

The developers needed to collaborate with other developers on other systems. The localized version control system failed in this case. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems were developed.

A centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all the versions of a project's files. Developers "check out" files from the central server, make changes, and then "check in" the updated files. Examples of CVCS include Subversion and Perforce.

### Distributed Version Control System

Centralized Version Control System uses a central server to store all the database and team collaboration. But due to single-point failure, which means the failure of the central server, developers do not prefer it. Next, the Distributed Version Control System is developed.

A distributed version control system (DVCS) allows developers to "clone" an entire repository, including the entire version history of the project. This means that they have a complete local copy of the repository, including all branches and past versions. Developers can work independently and then later merge their changes back into the main repository. Examples of DVCS include Git

### Centralized version control systems

1. In CVCS, The repository is placed at one place and delivers information to many clients.
    
2. It is based on the client-server approach.
    
3. It is the most straightforward system based on the concept of the central repository.
    
4. CVCS is easy to administrate and has additional control over users and access by its server from one place.
    
5. If the server fails, No system can access data from another system.
    
6. CVCS is easy to understand for beginners.
    

### **Distributed Version Control System**

1. In DVCS, Every user has a local copy of the repository in place of the central repository on the server-side.
    
2. The data access time in the case of multiple users is less in a distributed database.
    
3. The management, modification, and backup of this database are very difficult as it is spread across different physical locations.
    
4. In a distributed database, if one database fails users have access to other databases.
    
5. The response speed is less in comparison to a centralized database.
    
6. High performance because of the division of workload.
    
7. High availability because of the readiness of available nodes to do work.
    
8. Independent nodes and better control over resources.
    

### Why we use distributed version control over centralized version control?

Better collaboration: In a DVCS, every developer has a full copy of the repository, including the entire history of all changes. This makes it easier for developers to work together, as they don't have to constantly communicate with a central server to commit their changes or to see the changes made by others.

Improved speed: Because developers have a local copy of the repository, they can commit their changes and perform other version control actions faster, as they don't have to communicate with a central server.

Greater flexibility: With a DVCS, developers can work offline and commit their changes later when they do have an internet connection. They can also choose to share their changes with only a subset of the team, rather than pushing all of their changes to a central server.

Enhanced security: In a DVCS, the repository history is stored on multiple servers and computers, which makes it more resistant to data loss. If the central server in a CVCS goes down or the repository becomes corrupted, it can be difficult to recover the lost data.

Overall, the decentralized nature of a DVCS allows for greater collaboration, flexibility, and security, making it a popular choice for many teams.

### Git

It is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to track changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people. It is commonly used for software development, but it can be used to track changes to any set of files.

Git helps developers keep track of the history of their code files by storing them in different versions on its server repository.

## Features of Git

* **Open Source**  
    Git is an **open-source tool**. It is released under the **GPL** (General Public License) license.
    
* **Scalable**  
    Git is **scalable**, which means when the number of users increases, Git can easily handle such situations.
    
* **Distributed**  
    One of Git's great features is that it is **distributed**. Distributed means that instead of switching the project to another machine, we can create a "clone" of the entire repository. Also, instead of just having one central repository to which you send changes, every user has a repository that contains the entire commit history of the project. We do not need to connect to the remote repository; the change is just stored on our local repository. If necessary, we can push these changes to a remote repository.
    
* **Speed**  
    Git is very **fast**, so it can complete all the tasks in a while. Most of the git operations are done on the local repository, so it provides a **huge speed**. Also, a centralized version control system continually communicates with a server somewhere.
    
* # What is GitHub?
    
    GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. GitHub also facilitates many of its features, such as access control and collaboration. It provides a Web-based graphical interface.
    
    GitHub is an American company. It hosts the source code of your project in the form of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made by programmers.
    
    It offers both **distributed version control and source code management (SCM)** functionality of Git. It also facilitates some collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, and task management for every project.
    
* ## Features of GitHub
    
    GitHub is a place where programmers and designers work together. They collaborate, contribute, and fix bugs together. It hosts plenty of open-source projects and codes of various programming languages.
    
* Some of its significant features are as follows.
    
    * Collaboration
        
    * Integrated issue and bug tracking

### Task

1. How to install git step by step
    
    Git is an open-source distributed version control system that is available for everyone at zero cost. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among programmers. The version control allows you to track and work together with your team members at the same workspace.
    
    Git is the most common source code management (SCM) and covers more users than earlier VCS systems like SVN. Let's understand how to install Git on your Ubuntu server.
    

**Step1: Start the General OS and Package update**

First of all, we should start the general OS and package updates. To do so, run the below command:

$ sudo apt-get update

Now we have started the general OS and package updates. After this, we will run the general updates on the server so that we can get started with installing Git.

**Step2: Install Git**

To install Git, run the below command:

$ sudo apt-get install git

The above command will install Git on your system, but it may ask you to confirm the download and installation.

**Step3: Confirm Git the installation**

To confirm the installation, press the 'y' key on the editor. Now, Git is installed and ready to use.

$ git --version

**Step4: Configure the Git for the First use**

Now you can start using Git on your system. You can explore many features of the version control system. To go with Git, you have to configure the initial user access process. It can be done with the git config command.

To register a username, run the below command:

$ git config --global user.name "sinu"

To register an email address for the given author, run the below command:

$ git config --global user.name "sinu

Now, you have successfully registered a user for the version control system.

**Checking Your Settings**

You can check your configuration settings; you can use the **git config --list** command to list all the settings that Git can find at that point.

$ git config --list

This command will list all your settings. See the below command line output.
