In programming, a data type is a classification or categorization that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. Data types are essential because they determine how data is stored in memory and what operations can be performed on that data. Python, like many programming languages, supports several built-in data types. Here are some of the common data types in Python:

1. **Numeric Data Types:**
    
    * **int**: Represents numbers (integers). Example: `x = 5`
        
    * **float**: Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points). Example: `y = 3.14`
        
    * **complex**: Represents complex numbers. Example: `z = 2 + 3j`  
        
2. **Sequence Types:**
    
    * **str**: Represents strings (sequences of characters). Example: `text = "Hello, World"`
        
    * **list**: Represents lists (ordered, mutable sequences). Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
        
    * **tuple**: Represents tuples (ordered, immutable sequences). Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`
        
3. **Mapping Type:**
    
    * **dict**: Represents dictionaries (key-value pairs). Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}`
        
4. **Set Types:**
    
    * **set**: Represents sets (unordered collections of unique elements). Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`
        
    * **frozenset**: Represents immutable sets. Example: `my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])`
        
5. **Boolean Type:**
    
    * **bool**: Represents Boolean values (`True` or `False`). Example: `is_valid = True`
        
6. **Binary Types:**
    
    * **bytes**: Represents immutable sequences of bytes. Example: `data = b'Hello'`
        
    * **bytearray**: Represents mutable sequences of bytes. Example: `data = bytearray(b'Hello')`
        
7. **None Type:**
    
    * **NoneType**: Represents the `None` object, which is used to indicate the absence of a value or a null value.
        
8. **Custom Data Types:**
    
    * You can also define your custom data types using classes and objects.
        

## <mark>Strings</mark>

Strings in Python are surrounded by either single quotation marks or double quotation marks.'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the `print()` function:

#You can use double or single quotes:

print("Hello")

print('Hello')

## Multiline Strings

You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

<mark>program</mark>

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""

print(a)

* Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change the characters within a string directly. Instead, you create new strings.
    
* You can access individual characters in a string using indexing, e.g., `my_string[0]` will give you the first character.
    
* Strings support various built-in methods, such as `len()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, and more, for manipulation.
    

# [Numeric Data Type](https://github.com/devismita-12/python-for-devops/blob/main/Day-02/03-numeric.md#numberic-data-type)

* Python supports two primary numeric data types: `int` for integers and `float` for floating-point numbers.
    
* Integers are whole numbers, and floats can represent both whole and fractional numbers.
    
* You can perform arithmetic operations on these types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
    
* Be aware of potential issues with floating-point precision, which can lead to small inaccuracies in calculations.
    
* Python also provides built-in functions for mathematical operations, such as `abs()`, `round()`, and `math` module for advanced functions.
    

## [`Sequence Types:`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

The different types of containers used to store the data are [**List**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm), [**Tuple**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm), and [**String**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm). Lists are mutable and can hold data of any type, whereas Strings are immutable and can only store data of the str type. Tuples are immutable data types that can store any sort of value.

## **List**

The sequential data-type class includes the list data type. The list is the sole mutable data type in the sequential category. It can store any data type's values or components. Many procedures in the list can be changed and performed, such as [**append**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_append.htm), [**remove**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_remove.htm), [**insert**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_insert.htm), [**extend**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_extend.htm), [**reverse**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_reverse.htm), [**sorted**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_sort.htm), etc. We still have many more [**built-in functions**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_list_methods.htm) to manipulate lists.

## **Tuple**

Tuples are a data type that belongs to the sequence data type category. They're similar to lists in Python, but they have the property of being immutable. We can't change the elements of a tuple, but we can execute a [**variety of actions**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuple_methods.htm) on them such as count, index, type, etc.
