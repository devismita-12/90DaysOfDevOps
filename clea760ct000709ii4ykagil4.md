# Day 9 Task:

1. ### What is Git and why is it important?
    
    Git is a DevOps tool that is used for distributed version control systems and also used for tracking changes in computer files. Git is used to collaborate code, which can be done by multiple developers.
    
    **Git** is an **open-source distributed version control system**. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to coordinate the work among the developers.
    
2. ### What is the difference Between Main Branch and Master Branch??
    
    **Main** or **master** is the default branch when you create a repository. GitHub now uses **main** as its default branch while others still use **master.**
    
    Earlier, Microsoft GitHub also has a master as their default branch, but some peoples at Microsoft think that **master** name kind of similar to slavery, which is offensive according to Microsoft. Hence they changed its name to **main.**

1. ### How do you create a new repository on GitHub?
    
    You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open-source projects. With open-source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. You can use repositories to collaborate with others and track your work.

What is the difference between local & remote repositories? How to connect local to remote?

**The local repository** is a Git repository that is **stored on your computer.**

**The remote repository** is a Git repository that is **stored on some remote computer.**

The remote repository is usually used by teams as **a central repository** into which everyone pushes the changes from his local repository and from which everyone pulls changes to his local repository.  

When you are finished with doing changes to **your workspace**, you can add them to the **staging area** and from there you can commit the changes to your **local repository**. This can be done even when you are disconnected from the internet and **nobody else can see the changes** in your local repository.

### **task-1:**

**Set your user name and email address, which will be associated with your commits.**

### task-2:
