AWS zero to hero repo for DevOps engineers to learn AWS in 30 Days. This repo includes projects, presentations, interview questions and real-time examples.

## Day 1: Introduction to AWS

Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Oftentimes, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling.

## Day 2: IAM (Identity and Access Management)

With AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS, centrally manage fine-grained permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS.

## Day 3: EC2 Instances

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage

## Day 4: AWS Networking (VPC)

With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

## Day 5: AWS Security

AWS Security refers to **a range of qualities, tools, or features that make the public cloud service provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) secure**.

## Day 6: AWS Route 53

Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.

## Day 7: Secure VPC Setup with EC2 Instances

**Project:**

* Design and configure a VPC: Create a VPC with custom IP ranges. Set up public and private subnets. Configure route tables and associate subnets.
    
* Implement network security: Set up network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic. Configure security groups for EC2 instances to allow specific ports and protocols.
    
* Provision EC2 instances: Launch EC2 instances in both the public and private subnets. Configure security groups for the instances to allow necessary traffic. Create and assign IAM roles to the instances with appropriate permissions.
    
* Networking and routing: Set up an internet gateway to allow internet access for instances in the public subnet. Configure NAT gateway or NAT instance to enable outbound internet access for instances in the private subnet. Create appropriate route tables and associate them with the subnets.
    
* SSH key pair and access control: Generate an SSH key pair and securely store the private key. Configure the instances to allow SSH access only with the generated key pair. Implement IAM policies and roles to control access and permissions to AWS resources.
    
* Test and validate the setup: SSH into the EC2 instances using the private key and verify connectivity. Test network connectivity between instances in different subnets. Validate security group rules and network ACL settings.
    
    ## Day 8: Amazon S3
    
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.
    

## Day 9: AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.

## Day 10: AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Amazon Web Services (AWS) comprises over one hundred services, each of which exposes an area of functionality. While the variety of services offers flexibility for how you want to manage your AWS infrastructure, it can be challenging to figure out which services to use and how to provision them.

## Day 11: AWS CodeCommit

This day focuses on AWS CodeCommit, a managed source control service. You'll learn how to set up a Git repository in CodeCommit, collaborate with team members, and manage version control of your codebase.

## Day 12: AWS CodePipeline

***AWS CodePipeline*** is a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates.

## Day 13: AWS CodeBuild

***AWS CodeBuild*** is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software packages.

## Day 14: AWS CodeDeploy

***CodeDeploy*** is a deployment service that automates application deployments to ***Amazon EC2*** instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions

## Day 15: AWS CloudWatch

This day focuses on monitoring AWS resources using AWS CloudWatch. You'll learn how to create alarms, set up notifications, and collect metrics to gain insights into the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure.

## Day 16: AWS Lambda

This day introduces serverless computing with AWS Lambda. You'll learn how to create and deploy serverless functions, trigger them based on events, and leverage Lambda to build scalable and event-driven architectures
